The impact of categorical dummy variables on Data Scientist career based on the survey: An Application of Multiple Correspondence Analysis 
This paper explores a relationship between groups of users, experienced (or less experienced) with Data Science and differentiates their professional path. The aim of the project is to construct the correspondence map that enables us to visualize the relationships among the Data Science community. The main question is “Does the Data Science open enough to learn, or there is a dominant influence of certain factors such as sex, age or first learning language?” Using data is from the 2021 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey has taken 25,973 people. This sample of respondents approaches an interest in Data Science and a large majority of them have strong knowledge in Data Science. To examine which user characteristics are associated with the prevalent DS experience, a multiple correspondence analysis technique was performed.It is the Machine Learning & Data Science Survey survey hold by volunteer users on 2021, dedicated to understanding the audience of the site and topic of data science overall, and their behavior. It was also aimed to understand Data Science treds or patterns in audience behaviors. 
Namely, I made an analysis based on dummy variables such as age, sex, experience, country, and also main preference of programming languages, and notebooks, used for solving daily tasks.
This survey consists of 42+ questions and 25,973 responses, with multiple choice options, and mandatory general information. I have considered 15 questions.
##Multiple Correspondence Analysis
It is used for summarizing  for more than two categorical variables. It is used for multi-way contingency tables. 
The aim of MCA identify common elements in each group of individuals. Usually used in Survey data
Active individuals: indexing each individuals taken survey
Active variables: Language, and Notebook preference questions
Supplementary qualitative variables: age, sex, country, education
